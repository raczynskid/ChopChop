# ChopChop:<br> lightweight snipping tool

ChopChop was created as an alternative for bulkier screenshot tools such as
windows default snipping tool or Screenpresso.

The goal is to be as quick, lightweight and minimalistic as possible - to accomplish
the same things with fewest mouse clicks possible.

Main characteristics:
-
- You start snipping immediately after running ChopChop - 
this will be indicated by cursor changing to crosshair
- There is no static menu or window 
- You choose what you want to do with your
snip by using the contextual menu that appears after you select the area
- If you press ESC at any stage, ChopChop is gone and out of your way
- Default saving behavior is to just give the name of the file (it will be saved at a default location) - if you're taking
a bunch of screenshots in quick succession, no need to go through the browse window every time.
- Pop open the default folder at any time - just right click anywhere in 
snipping mode or with context menu open to see all your saved snips
